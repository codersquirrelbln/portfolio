      <h1>Hi, my name is Elisa, a back-end developer based in Berlin.</h1>
      <p>My first passion was art conservation which was my main focus for the past 15 years. Then programming came along and swept me off my feet. I started with self teaching, then concluded a coding boot camp (@LeWagon) and am now working as a back end developer. Please feel free to look at my current and future projects and reach out to me.</p>

         <h2>Hi, my name is Elisa, a back-end developer based in Berlin.</h2>
         <p>
          My first passion was art conservation which was my main focus for the past 15 years. Then programming came along and swept me off my feet. I started with self teaching, then concluded a coding boot camp (@LeWagon) and am now working as a back end developer. Please feel free to look at my current and future projects and reach out to me.

              <h2>Visa Calculator</h2>
              <p>
                The visa calculator enables travellers to calculate one or multiple trips to a country or visa zone such as the Schengen Zone. The user can insert individual visa regulations such as ho many days out if a time frame you may be in the country. It informs the user how many days they can still use up or have to remove to not overstay the visit.
                This project was built using JavaScript and made use of the flatpickr as a datetime picker and is still a work in progress…

          Working in teams is hard. When working on a project by yourself, you are the one with all the strings in hand. You decide in which direction the product will move, what to add, what the MVP should include,
          how fast to move. In a team, you have to come to a consensus. You have to slow down situations to not jump the gun but follow the order of things.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the day with having a new look at where we are at and what needs to be achieved for that workday and divide up the different tasks to the team members will help immensely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a list of tasks easily accessible to all team members at all times. The team members, for their part, need to inform on what their current task is and continuously update their progress.
          This way, everyone is always up to date, can check in with their colleagues to see if they need help with a task (or the team member can add another colleague to a task to let them know they need support),
          others can know which task is still open or if it makes sense to start a task if the task directly previous, that needs to be done before it can continue down that line. Others can see if it makes sense to
          pick up a task that depends on another task to be completed. It is also motivating and keeps up morale to see how we as a team are advancing, that the progress we make does advance the product.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communication. Probably the biggest part of working in a team, that needs to be the top priority above all else. If there is no (good and productive) communication, there won't be a (good) product that users
          will use. And does a product that has no users even exist? The tree that falls when no one is around doesn't make a sound. Even working at one workstation does not mean there will be automatic communication.
          Using tools like Slack also help have a record that you can refer to when things get hectic. When communicating with each other, be kind to one another, respectful, try to see where the other person is coming
          from. Give constructive criticism, say why you prefer one solution over the other so that the other person can understand here YOU are coming from.
        </li>
        <li>
          You need to be on top of your game. When multiple people work on the same documents, even when they are on different tasks in different parts of the code, it can get confusing.
          Not jumping to the next task without consulting the task list and its assignees is fundamental.
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone has to be in charge. Even in a team as small as three, someone has to take the lead and keep an eye on things so the overview is safe and up to date. The person in charge doesn't have to be the same
          every day, but one has to be the go-to person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every day you learn an increased amount. Give yourself breaks. There is no sense in pushing and pushing until exhaustion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different people will care different amounts about the product. In result they will invest different amounts of energy, time and emotion into it. You have to be ok with that and keep true to what you want
          to invest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on yourself and your tasks but don't lose sight of what the rest of the team is up to.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Vue.js, RoR as an API, and TDD
          <p class="mt-2 text-base"> After doing a deep dive into Vue.js (and absolutely loving it!) and learning more about using Ruby on Rails as an API,
            I started a completely new repository, leaving the first version of the flashcard app behind, that I started building
            using only RoR. This gave me a chance to rethink the application more and apply all the newly acquired knowledge.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">I am thrilled about how the project is coming along and learning so much along the way. I want to put an emphasis
            on the territory of TDD, which I didn't know a lot about and was somehow a little intimidating by. However, learning
            from a colleague <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bsDBNvCZEEjrjFdFLtIYAand" target="_blank" class="custom-link">Juan Vqz</a>
            and his tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4yLj0azo9NU-qUCvSUZSm92gdxFJAWRc" target="_blank" class="custom-link"> Vue and RoR </a>
            that all changed rapidly, and I am all aboard, seeing how much easier it makes life in the long run. So thank you for that, Juan!</p>

          Implementing an API to fetch pictures from Unsplash
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">Inside this, limiting the amount of pictures displayed with the option to show more results.
            The amount of learning you can achieve by only one “little" feature is immense and very satisfying.
            I had been working on this feature to use unsplash as a resource for pictures for a day, watching tutorials, 
            reading medium articles and stack overflow threads. It would just not come together.
            Before it got to a level of frustration that makes it hard to get back from, I took a break, went for a run,
            had something to eat and listened to my audiobook for 5 minutes while my mind was already heading back to coding.
            And low and behold, I read one more medium article, and all of a sudden it did work! All of the stress and insecurities
            and frustration just went away and were forgotten about and I moved on to the next feature - after staging my stages to
            git of course!</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">The process taught me the value of stepping back and approaching a problem with a fresh perspective.</p>

        <li>Always have your server logs open when coding
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">When creating a new card, the user can pick more than one deck in which the card should be placed. However this did not work.
            After studying the server logs in real time for a few tries, and using tools such as Postman and the useful <code>console.log(something I want to know, such as data)</code>,
            it turned out that the data set that was passed along to the database had a slightly different syntax than expected.
            Namely the array of deck-ids were not found within the card parameters.</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            Parameters: {“word"=>"nuevo", "translation"=>"new", "picture"=>"", "hint"=>"", "flipped"=>false, "deck_ids"=>[12, 11], "card"=>{"word"=>"nuevo", "translation"=>"new", "picture"=>"", "hint"=>"", "flipped"=>false}}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">It turns out that I had to change the axios syntax in the store very slightly from</p>
          <code>return axios.post('/cards', card)</code>
          <p class="mt-2">to</p>
          <code>return axios.post('/cards', {card: card})</code>.
          <pre>
            <code>
              Parameters: {“card"=>{"word"=>"el maestro", “translation"=>"the teacher", "picture"=>"", "hint"=>"", "flipped"=>false, "deck_ids"=>[12, 11]}}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="mt-2 text-base">
            Credit for finding and fixing the error goes to <a href="https://www.dimitribosch.com/" target="blank" class="custom-link">Dimi</a>. Some things just come with experience, I would not have found the solution to that online, and it is still unclear, why only deck-ids was placed outside of the card parameters.

        <li>Issue Tracker</li>
          Stephanie and I started using GitLab's issues to track discussions and document our decision making process and results. We are only a team of two at the moment, but for future projects we want to collaborate and work in larger teams, that will most likely work in an asynchronous manner.
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>
              By opening issues and linking/assigning the members that should be involved in the decision making process and/or will be affected by the results, everyone is up to date on the status, can ask questions to clarify points, and contribute to the final results, independently from other team members making time to bring them up to speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Issue opener can serve as a moderator for the issue or assign someone else to take charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nothing gets dropped, the issues can serve as a to do list, it is easily visible if issue still needs resolving or are closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Issues document when decisions were made, why, how and by whom. Others can reread the documentation in an efficient way, instead of having to set up a chat with coworkers - who might work in different time zones or don’t have room in their schedule in a timely manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              All discussions are linked to the project, all essential information is gathered in one place and available for other collaborators or new team members. They don't have to give them access to googledDocs or sending phone protocols back and forth.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are other options such as Milestone or Due Date, that we will still have to include in the issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Starting an Error Log</li>
          I started a file to record the errors I encounter along the way, plus the solution. This way with a reoccurring error I know where to check first, because contrary to my own believe, I will surely remember next time how I solves this” is not always true. unfortunately;

          Especially helpful when start using a new programming language or framework, and you are still not familiar with all the errors.

    <h6 class="text-sm font-normal my-2 mt-6">rreminder TDD</h6>
        <p class="mt-2 text-base">
         TDD does not only force you to be clear about the user journey, validations and associations of the models before starting to write the rest of the code, but it also serves as a guideline, a checklist.
         I had an incredible time improving my skills with testing. I especially liked using <a href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara" target="_blank" class="custom-link">capybara</a> and
         <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot" target="_blank" class="custom-link">FactoryBot</a> to go through one user journey at a time. Tests lead you where the code needs to go,
         the minimalistic approach makes the best of your time and resources, keeping the code clean, clear and light. I didn't include tests for controllers or views, as they are partially included
         in the feature and model tests and we can trust rails and devise to do their job.
        </p>
        <h6 class="text-sm font-normal my-2 mt-6">Obstacles</h6>
        <p class="mt-2 text-base">
          At the beginning, I was uncertain how many helpers and gems I should use. I want to show off, that I understand and am familiar with the basics. However, coding is about trade offs and code needs to be shipped,
          sometimes better sooner than later. I had started writing tests for the user and reminder models and consequently generated the models, when I decided that my main focus should not be to create the login/out logic,
          but more on the actual reminder functionality and email sending. So I changed to using the <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise" target="_blank" class="custom-link">devise gem</a> to help me out and make my life easier.
          In retrospect that should have been the approach from the beginning, as I saw it causing problems now. Creating a new user model with devise caused conflicts with the already existing model. I did not have anything in my database,
          so I decided to drop it in order to delete the first model table to enable a new migration. It is not best practice to delete migration files, and in retrospect it would have been better to drop the tables in newly generated migrations.

            Be even clearer from the beginning, which gems and helpers I would want to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take ownership of my code and my mistakes, not deleting migration files. Show where you go wrong and show how you fix it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tests are like a to do list and fixing the rake one by one is like detective work. Both I really like!

            It might feel like a waste of time, especially with the pressure of a deadline to do a deep dive into a topic; however the learning effect is much higher when making it the number one priority to understand the code and know how to write it yourself.
            In short term it might seem more plausible to jump right in and look up topics as you go. Long term it makes much more sense to approach it just with that in mind: the long term benefits. You are not only learning to solve this problem in front of
            you to pass a test - it just serves as a vehicle - , but you learn to be the best developer you can be. In that sense it is similar to being a health care professional. If you have seen a certain illness before, you have a much better chance of
            recognizing the symptoms the next time a patients presents with them, hence making it more likely that you can heal your patient or doing so much faster. That knowledge in itself is very valuable, but it also enables you to share this information
            and experience and teach it to someone else. This way, you are not only enabling yourself, but also empowering the developers around you, in your team and beyond - an amazing opportunity to contribute to someone else's learning process.
